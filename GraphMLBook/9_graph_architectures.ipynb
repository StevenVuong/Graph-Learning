    "## Lambda Architectures\n",
    "Focus of scalable architectures that can handle large amounts of data and can provide alerts in real time, using the latest available information. These systems must scale to large number of users or data by increasing resources horizontally or vertically. Lambda architecture is designed to process massive quantities of data and ensure large throughput efficiently, preserving reduced latency and ensuring fault tolerance and negligible errors. We have three different layers:\n",
    "- **batch layer**: Sits on top of the storage system, and can handle all historical data, as well as perform **online analytical processing (OLAP)** computation on the entire dataset. New data is continuously ingested and stored. Large-scale processing typically achieved via massively parallel jobs, aiming to produce aggregation, structuring and computation of relevant information. In terms of ML, model training that relies on historic information is generally done at this layer, producing a trained model to be used in either batch prediction or real-time execution.\n",
    "- **speed layer**: Low-latency layer allows real-time processing of information to provide timely updates and information. Generally fed by a streaming process, usually involving fast computation that does not require a long computational time or load. Produces output integrated with data generated by batch layer in (near) real time, providing support for **OLTP** operations. May also use some outputs of OLTP computations, such as trained model. Often ML models that serve predictions are embedded in speed layers.\n",
    "- **serving layer**: Duty to organise, structure and index information for fast data retrieval from batch and speed layer. Thus integrates outputs of batch layer with most updated and real-time information of speed-layer to deliver user a unified and coherent view of the data. Serving layer can be composed of a persistence layer that integrates both historic aggregation and real-time updates. Information generally exposed to user via direct connection to DB or accessible with specific domain query language, such as SQL or via dedicated RESTful API servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main pros with Lambda architecture:\n",
    "-  **No server management**: Abstracts functional layers so no installing, maintaining or administering any software/infrastructure\n",
    "-  **Flexible Scaling**: Can be automatic to scale horizontally or vertically\n",
    "-  **Automated high availability**: Represents serverless design which already has built-in availability and fault tolerance\n",
    "-  **Business agility**: Reacts in real time to changing business/market scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Separate two interconnected processing flows: **batch layer** and **speed layer**, requiring developers to build and maintain separate code bases for batch and stream processes, requiring more complexity and overhead code management.\n",
